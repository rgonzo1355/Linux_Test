## Remote Connection Methods SOP

### Purpose

The purpose of this SOP is to provide IT personnel with guidelines for configuring and managing remote connection methods, including RDP, SSH, and remote desktop viewer applications. This ensures secure and efficient remote access to organizational systems whether Windows, Mac, or Linux.

### Authorship

This SOP is authored by [Author's Full Name].

### Definitions

- **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):** A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection.
- **SSH (Secure Shell):** A cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** A technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.
- **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure):** A set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out routine operations.

### Scope

This SOP applies to IT personnel responsible for configuring and managing remote connection methods for organizational users.

### Responsibilities

The following IT personnel are responsible for implementing this SOP:

- **IT Department –** Configuration and maintenance of remote connection methods.
- **System Administrators –** Granting and revoking remote access privileges.
- **Security Team –** Monitoring and addressing security concerns related to remote connections.

### Prerequisites

Before configuring remote connection methods, the following tasks must be complete:

1. Ensure that IT personnel have the necessary privileges and access to configure remote connections.
2. Verify that the required software for remote connections is installed on IT workstations.

### Procedure

#### 1. RDP Configuration

a. **Install RDP Client:**
   i. Ensure that the appropriate RDP client is installed on IT workstations.
      - [Windows RDP Client](Microsoft RDP Client)
      - [Mac RDP Client](Mac RDP Client)
      - Linux: If you don’t have Remmina on your Ubuntu installation, install it with `sudo apt install remmina remmina-plugin-vnc`. You can also use snap package (`sudo snap install remmina`). [Ubuntu Installation](Ubuntu Installation of Remmina)

b. **Obtain RDP Connection Details:**
   i. Retrieve the necessary RDP connection details from the relevant sources, such as the IT ticketing system.

c. **Configure RDP Client:**
   i. Open the RDP client and enter the provided connection details.
   ii. Set display and other preferences as needed.
   iii. Configure advanced settings, if applicable.

d. **Test RDP Connection:**
   i. Initiate a connection using the configured RDP client.
   ii. Verify successful access to the remote desktop.
   iii. Troubleshoot and resolve any connectivity issues if encountered.

e. **Additional Security Measures:**
   i. Implement multi-factor authentication if supported.
   ii. Ensure that RDP traffic is encrypted using secure protocols.

#### 2. SSH Configuration

a. **Install SSH Client:**
   i. Ensure that the appropriate SSH client is installed on IT workstations.
      - [Windows SSH Client](Windows SSH Client)
      - [Linux SSH Client](Linux SSH Client)

b. **Obtain SSH Connection Details:**
   i. Retrieve the necessary SSH connection details from the relevant sources.

c. **Configure SSH Client:**
   i. Open the SSH client and enter the provided connection details.
   ii. Specify authentication method (password or key-based).
   iii. Set other preferences, such as terminal settings or tunneling options.

d. **Test SSH Connection:**
   i. Connect to the remote server using the configured SSH client.
   ii. Verify successful authentication and access.
   iii. Troubleshoot and resolve any issues encountered during the connection.

e. **Additional Security Measures:**
   i. Encourage key-based authentication for enhanced security.
   ii. Disable root login if not required.

#### 3. Remote Team Viewer Configuration

a. **Install Team Viewer:**
   i. Ensure that the appropriate remote desktop viewer application is installed on IT workstations. [TeamViewer Installation](TeamViewer Installation)

b. **Obtain Connection Details:**
   i. Retrieve the necessary connection details from the relevant sources.

c. **Configure Remote Desktop Viewer:**
   i. Open the remote desktop viewer application and add a new connection.
   ii. Enter the provided connection details, including protocol (VNC, RDP, etc.).
   iii. Adjust display settings and other preferences.

d. **Test Remote Desktop Connection:**
   i. Connect to the remote desktop using the configured viewer.
   ii. Confirm successful viewing and interaction with the remote desktop.
   iii. Address any issues encountered during the connection.

e. **Additional Security Measures:**
   i. Ensure that the remote desktop viewer uses secure protocols.
   ii. Consider using VPN or other secure networks for remote desktop access.
